Absolutely. Here's a reworded, layman's version of your framework discovery questions. This version is simplified and focused on making it easy for anyone — even without a tech background — to understand and answer:


---

1. Where does the test input data come from?

Are you using Excel sheets, CSV files, a database, or something else to supply the data to the test cases?

Do you load this data automatically or enter it manually?



---

2. How are the test cases arranged and run?

Are the test cases written as a sequence of steps?

Do some test steps run before or after others (like setup or cleanup)?

Is there any logic that tells the test to repeat or skip some steps?



---

3. What types of checks are done during testing?

Do you check the response from the API (like status code, message text, or data values)?

Do you compare the result with what’s in a database?

Do you read from or compare files like XML, CSV, or PDFs?

Do you pass values between steps automatically?



---

4. How do you get the test results or reports?

Are you using the built-in report from ReadyAPI?

Do you have your own customized report format, like HTML, Excel, or PDF?

Do you store logs or results in a tool like Kibana or just save it locally?



---

5. Do the tests use any custom logic or code?

Is there any scripting (Groovy code) involved in running or customizing the tests?

Is this scripting used for calculations, decision-making, or changing test data during execution?



---

6. Are any third-party tools or libraries used in scripting?

Does the script use any extra tools or packages to work with Excel, read JSON, handle files, etc.?

Were any external JAR files or plugins added to the project?



---

7. How do you handle authentication (like login or tokens)?

Does your test need to log in or get a token before running?

Is there a special request that runs first to get the token?

Do you reuse that token across all other requests?



---

8. Do you test in different environments (like dev, test, prod)?

Is there an easy way to switch between different environments?

Are environment-specific details (like URLs or tokens) stored in properties or settings?



---

9. Do you test with multiple sets of data?

Does the same test case run multiple times with different data values (like different usernames, account numbers, etc.)?

Where does this data come from — Excel, database, or CSV?

How do you repeat the test for each row of data?



---

10. Are any test cases connected or dependent on others?

Do some test cases rely on previous ones to run successfully first?

Are you passing data from one test to another?



---

11. Can this framework be extended or reused easily?

Do you have shared scripts or utilities that multiple test cases use?

Is it easy to add new types of tests or make changes without redoing everything?



---

Extra Add-On (Optional):

If you're planning to move this to Postman or REST-assured:

How do you want to group test cases (e.g., by feature or endpoint)?

Do you need to create environment files or variable files?

Should we include token generation or login steps as part of each run?
