# Browser-use Summary

**Overview:**
Browser-use is a Python library that enables AI agents to control web browsers using natural language instructions, with 58.4k GitHub stars indicating significant popularity.

**Core functionality:**
- Connects LLMs (like GPT-4) to browser automation via Playwright
- Uses AI to interpret DOM, make decisions, and execute browser actions
- Maintains memory between steps for complex workflows
- Supports various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.)

**Technical workflow:**
1. User provides a task description
2. LLM creates a plan and analyzes DOM state
3. AI decides actions based on webpage content
4. Actions are executed via Playwright
5. Process repeats with feedback loop

**Limitations:**
- Python version constraints (works only with 3.11-3.12 for full functionality)
- High token consumption and associated costs
- Performance dependent on LLM quality
- Challenges with special UI elements
- Less deterministic than traditional automation

**Memory functionality:**
- Helps agent maintain context across multi-step workflows
- Requires Python <3.13 due to PyTorch compatibility
- Significantly improves performance for complex tasks

**Comparison to Selenium:**
- More adaptive to UI changes but less deterministic
- Uses natural language instead of explicit programming
- Better for complex workflows requiring reasoning
- Potentially higher operational costs

Browser-use represents a shift from explicit programming to instruction-based automation, trading some reliability for flexibility and ease of use.
